# How-To Instructions

This README will describe all the functionalities of the items __OR__ commands used within the Blockzone battlegrounds

### Firing

The weapons in Blockzone really are state-of-the-art! Any equipped weapon can be fired with `Right-Click`. Make sure you have ammunition though!!!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Plate-Up

Body Armor can be bought in the store/shop and will keep you somewhat safe on your endeavours. But what happens when your body armor is compromised?? To use Body Armor for re-plating:
  1. Equip the NEW body armor in your main hand
  2. Right-Click to equip the new Body Armor!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Rucksack

The rucksack allows you to long-term store iems you find in the world. This is useful not only in increasing your inventory size, but also in the sense that if there are any items stored inside upon death or dismemberment will __NOT__ be lost! Make sure to utilize your rucksack smartly to ensure no key items are lost in game!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Cash Vouchers

Cash Vouchers can only be found inside of lootboxes and are generated randomly. These vouchers will reward the player with a random amount of money for locating the lootbox and are a one-time use only. To use:
  1. Equip the cash voucher
  2. Right-Click to cash in your reward!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Death Chests

Death Chests are dropped when a player dies from ANY cause. These chests will be cleared after a specified time, but will contain the items of the player that were not inside a rucksack and are free to loot when found.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Grenades (Big Balls / Shlongenthrowen)

Grenades are fun! To use:
  1. Equip the grenade
  2. Press `Q` to throw and make sure you are NOT near the explosion!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### S.O.S

The `/bzsos` command is used when you are looking to get to a guaranteed safe location, the Battle Lobby. This command, however, has a small price to pay: you will be locked in place for 30 seconds, and your vision will ZOOM in, semi-obscuring your ability to see and engage. Make sure you are clear and in a safe spot before enacting this command!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Blockzone Store

The __Blockzone Store__ is the default plugin store where weapons, ammo, and food can be bought from. Make sure you have the necessary funds for your purchase by using the `/bzb bal` OR `/bzbank bal` command! Simply find the item you want and give it a click! Your funds will be adjusted and you will own the item.

> _Note: DO NOT click your inventory while the Store is open! You WILL purchase that item regardless if you just purchsed it again! Close the Store, then move your items around :)_

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Blockzone Player Shop

The __Blockzone Player Shop__ is a great place to sell/buy items that have been found in world and posted. This command AND the shop can __only be used or accessed in the Battle Lobby__, but is used like this:
  1. Equip the item you want to sell in your Main Hand
  2. Type `/sell [amount]` where the amount is the price you are selling it for
  3.  To view your item, simply type `/bzshop` to see the Player Shop
